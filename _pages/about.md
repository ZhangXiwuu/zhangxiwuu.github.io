Xiwu Zhang is a Ph.D. student from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST).](http://www.njust.edu.cn/)

- He received his B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 2014, majoring in mechanical engineering and automation. 
- He is currently pursuing his Ph.D degree at School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China.
- During June, 2017 and June, 2018, He was visiting the School of Computing and Information Technology, [University of Wollongong (UOW)](https://www.uow.edu.au/), Australia.

His main research interest includes **computer vision, deep learning and robotics**. For computer vision and deep learning, he is interested in visual place recognition, image retrieval, deep learning-based image representations and deep convolutional neural networks for image processing and so on. For robotics, he focuses on visual-based autonomous robots/vehicles, including visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), deep learning-based loop closure detection and perception with multiple imaging data (e.g., RGB-D images).
